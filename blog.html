          <h2>Inspiration</h2>
          <p>This restaurant is owned by me and my husband. It is a every good chance to use my knowledge from this course to make a website for this restaurant.
            The design of the restaurant logo is based on black and white. I will also deisgn the website mainly using black and white.
            I want to make the website contains art perspective, not only a restaurant page. I will try to make it cool commsercial website.
            I will use all the images that I took by myself for the restaurant. I will also add a audio in the website. </p>
